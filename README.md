For testing purpose :
  1. clone or download this repository
  2. cd geocrowd
  3. ionic platform add android
  4. ionic platform add ios (for mac user only)
  5. ionic run android

OR download directly from here:

Note:
unfortunately, my beloved phone's RAM (Xiaomi redmi 2) can't handle running cordova application plus native camera application. Every time i touch a button that connected to cordova-camera-plugin, the main app is destroyed. So for the camera, i think i'll left it as is until i find alternative plugin

PS. I'm trying to improve my english here, any corrections are welcomed (duh)
